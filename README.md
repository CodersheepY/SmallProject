# SmallProject

#### Day1

Implemented and tested a Flask backend for product sales and inventory management, including routes for updating sales, restocking, and retrieving product information, with comprehensive unit tests.

#### Day2

Three new features were added to the Flask application today: retrieving product summaries, deleting products, and updating product information. The product summary feature allows for the aggregation of total sales and total stock across all products. The delete feature enables the removal of specified products from the system. The update feature supports modifying the name and description of existing products via a `PUT` request. All these features have been validated through unit tests.

#### Day3

The project setup involved creating and activating a Python virtual environment, installing Flask and related dependencies, and configuring the Flask application with SQLite for database management. Key functionalities such as retrieving product information, updating stock and sales, deleting products, and generating product summaries were implemented within the `backend` directory using `app.py` and `product_management.py`. The front-end dependencies were installed, and a React application was successfully built in the `frontend` directory. A `vercel.json` file was created to configure the Vercel deployment, integrating both the front-end and back-end components. The code was then pushed to GitHub, and the project was deployed on Vercel. Subsequent steps will involve testing to ensure the deployment's success.
